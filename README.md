<h1>Algorithm for file updates in Python


<h2>Description</h2>
Within this project, access to restricted content is controlled with an allow list of IP addresses. The “allow_list.txt” file displays these IP addresses. A remove list identifies IP addresses that should not have access to this content. An algorithm was created to automate updating the “allow_list.txt” file and remove the IP addresses that are located within the remove file.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>

Open the file that contains the allow list </h> 
For the first part of the algorithm, I opened the “allow_list.txt” file and assigned file name as a string to the import_file variable:
